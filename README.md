Welcome to Overrotten!

Overrotten is an app specially designed for recording the grocery so that users are reminded to consume food before its expiring date. It was developed with Flutter and Dart in Android Studio. Users can add food with its name, quantity, stored position and expiring date as well as view the list of food they currently have. Color-coded status “FRESH”, “EXPIRING” and “EXPIRED” will remind users of the freshness of the food. Once users have consumed some or all the food, they can edit the quantity or simply delete the food.
